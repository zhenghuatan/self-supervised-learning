Slides for the tutorial at NLDL 2023

[Z.-H. Tan, Tutorial on Self-Supervised Learning: Training Targets and Loss Functions at Northern Lights Deep Learning Conference 2023, Troms√∏, Norway](https://github.com/zhenghuatan/self-supervised-learning/blob/main/20230109_NLDL_Tutorial_Tan.pdf).


PhD stipend

We have one PhD position available in Self-Supervised Learning for Decoding of Complex Signals, funded by the [Pioneer Centre for AI](aicentre.dk). The project aims to develop novel semi-supervised and self-supervised methods for modeling signals of various modalities (e.g., speech, audio, vision, text) and analyse the complexity of the developed models. Good opportunities to do research at other units and the headquarter of the Pioneer Centre as well as abroad.
Deadline: 2 April 2023. [Online application here](https://www.vacancies.aau.dk/show-vacancy/?vacancy=1204355).
